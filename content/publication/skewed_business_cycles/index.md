abstract: Do larger firms have moreproductivetechnologies, are their technologiesmorescalable, or both? We use administrative data on Canadian and USfirms to estimate a joint distribution of output elasticities of capital, labor,and intermediate inputs—thus, returns to scale (RTS)—along with total fac-tor productivity (TFP). We find significant heterogeneity in RTS across firmswithin industries. Furthermore, larger firms operate technologies with higherRTS, whereas the largest firms do not exhibit the highest TFP. Higher RTS forlarge firms are entirely driven by higher intermediate input elasticities. Descrip-tively, these align with higher intermediate input revenue shares. We also showthat high-RTS firms grow faster, pay higher wages, and are owned by wealth-ier households. We then incorporate RTS heterogeneity into the workhorsemodel of endogenous entrepreneurship that matches the observed heterogene-ity in TFP and RTS. We find that the efficiency losses from financial frictionsare more than twice as large compared to a conventional calibration that at-tributes all heterogeneity to TFP and assumes a common RTS parameter.
